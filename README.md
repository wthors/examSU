## **Breakout Game using DIKUArcade**

This project is part of the **Software Development 2025** course at the University of Copenhagen.  
We implemented a foundational Breakout-style game using the **DIKUArcade** game engine.  

The current version includes:
- **Level Loading**: Parses ASCII text files to generate levels with blocks.
- **Block Entities**: Includes support for normal and hardened blocks with health.
- **Player Paddle**: Controlled via arrow keys, respecting screen boundaries.
- **Hazards**: Spawn randomly when breaking a non special block
- **Power-Ups**: Spawn when breaking a power-up block
- **Winning and Lives**: Completing all levels will now "win" the game
- **Modular Design**: Classes are separated by responsibility (player, block, level loading).
- **Unit Tests**: Built using NUnit for verifying movement, block behavior, and file parsing.

### AI Usage 
<pr> Le Chat - Mistral AI and chatgpt was used to answer questions about:<ul>
    <li>Csharp coding</li>
    <li>Design patterns</li>
    <li>Troubleshooting (when code failed, a screenshot was sent to Le Chat and ChatGPT with questions to help understand what went wrong)</li>

<pr> AI was not used to write code directly for this assignment.
All solutions were independently implemented, tested, and reviewed by the group. Any AI-assisted suggestions were critically evaluated and adapted to the course requirements.</pr>
